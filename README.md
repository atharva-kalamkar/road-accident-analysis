📊 Road Accident Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI.
The goal of the analysis is to explore accident trends, identify key contributing factors, and help support data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements.

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle, containing detailed records of road accidents, weather conditions, vehicle data, time factors, and severity indicators.

🔍 Project Overview

Road accidents are a major social and economic concern. This dashboard provides insights into:

Accident frequency across regions

Severity levels and hotspots

Time-based patterns (hour, day, month, season)

Weather and road condition impacts

Vehicle types involved

Contributing human and environmental factors

The analysis aims to help stakeholders like traffic departments, policymakers, and researchers understand patterns and reduce accident rates.

📈 Insights Summary

The Road Accident Analysis dashboard reveals several important patterns and correlations within the dataset:

1. Peak Accident Time & Day Patterns

Accidents occur most frequently during late afternoon and evening hours, particularly between 4 PM – 8 PM, which aligns with peak traffic and commuting periods.

Weekends show a noticeable rise in high-severity accidents, possibly due to higher speeds, leisure travel, and reduced enforcement.

2. Weather & Road Condition Impact

Clear weather accounts for the majority of total accidents due simply to frequency of occurrence, but rain, fog, and snow show a higher proportion of severe accidents, indicating reduced visibility and slippery road surfaces.

Poor road surface conditions (wet, icy, muddy) significantly correlate with increased accident severity.

3. Severity Distribution

Most accidents fall under “Slight” severity, but “Serious” and “Fatal” accidents display clearer clustering patterns around:

adverse weather

high-speed road types

junction-heavy urban zones

nighttime or early morning hours

4. Location & Hotspot Trends

Urban areas experience the highest accident volume due to dense traffic.

Rural and highway routes, although lower in total accidents, tend to have more severe outcomes because of higher travel speeds.

Junction types such as T-junctions, roundabouts, and crossroads show elevated accident counts.

5. Vehicle Type Contribution

Cars are involved in the majority of incidents, consistent with vehicle density.

However, motorcycles and heavy vehicles contribute disproportionately to fatal-level severity, highlighting vulnerability and kinetic impact forces.

6. Temporal Trends

Accidents peak during late months of the year, where weather worsens and days get shorter.

Seasonal patterns indicate that winter months correlate with more severe collisions.

7. Human & Environmental Factors

Speeding, distraction, and failure to judge vehicle movement appear as recurring contributing factors.

Environmental influences such as dark lighting conditions, curvy road design, and poor signage further elevate risk.
